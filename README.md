# SimCLR-PyTorch-Implementation

Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful technique for learning representations without the need for labeled data. SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) is one such approach that leverages contrastive learning to
learn visual representations. This notebook outlines the implementation of SimCLR using the STL-10
dataset in PyTorch.
